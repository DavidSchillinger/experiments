import {UseState} from './UseState'

# [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)

Store any [value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures) as [component state](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory).

## Anatomy

```tsx
function Component() {
    const [text, setText] = useState('Hello')
    //    |state |setter            |initial value

    return <Input value={text} onValueChange={setText}/>
}
```

## Dos, don'ts and other hints

✅: Do use the provided setter to update: `setState('New value!')`<br/>
❗: Don't mutate state. `state.prop = 'Not reactive!'`<br/>
💡: Avoiding mutation ensures React is aware of our changes and can re-render the component accordingly.<br/>

✅: Do treat state from `useState` as the single source of truth for the data it holds.<br/>
❗: Don't pass state (or props) to `useState`, this leads to state duplication.<br/>
💡: To compute another value from state (or props), use [useMemo](/docs/documentation-hooks-usememo--docs) instead.<br/>

✅: Do use the updater callback to update based on current state: `setAge(current => current + 1)`<br/>
⚠️: Avoid using the state variable for this. [_In some cases_](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#updating-state-based-on-the-previous-state) it will use stale data: `setAge(age + 1)`<br/>
💡: Updating state based on the previous state can be done in two ways. Prefer the updater callback for consistency and to avoid stale data usage.<br/>

## Rendering

The `<UseState/>` component in these examples holds the `useState` hook.
