# Names

## Casing

All identifiers use `camelCase`, with the following exceptions:
- Component names use `PascalCase` as per React convention.
- Types and enums use `PascalCase` as per TypeScript convention.

## Content

- 💡: Variable names should express what data, and ideally type, the variable contains.<br/>
- 💡: Variable names should be unambiguous, and ideally short, but prefer a clear long name over an ambiguous short name.<br/>
e.g.: `itemList` may be unambiguous, but could be shortened to `items`.<br/>
- ❗: Don't use abbreviations unless the abbreviation is widely understood. Including by people unfamiliar with the application domain.<br/>
Reasonable abbreviations may include: `id`, `ms`, `props` and `config`.<br/>
- ✅: Do use plurals to identify collections.<br/>
e.g.: It's reasonable to assume `items` refers to an `Item[]` or similar, but not a `number`.<br/>
Common exceptions: `props` and `options`.<br/>
- ✅: Do include a unit name if it's otherwise ambiguous. e.g. `delay` vs `delayMs`.<br/>
- ✅: Do include a type name if it's otherwise ambiguous. e.g. `year` vs `yearString`.<br/>
Booleans can often be formatted like a yes/no question. e.g. `is<something>`, `has<something>` or `should<something>`.<br/>
Functions _do things_, try prefixing with a verb: e.g. `createUser()` instead of `user()`<br/>
Numbers often _count things_, e.g. `userCount` instead of `users`.<br/>

## Props

- 💡: [General naming conventions](#content) apply.<br/>
- ✅: Do use `render<SlotName>` for render props.<br/>
- ✅: Do use `on<EventName>` for event props.<br/>
⚠️: Try to avoid tight coupling between components through naming.<br/>
e.g.: Prefer `onUserEdited={setUser}` over `setUser={setUser}`<br/>
💡: Child components ideally don't care what parent components do with the event data. See [dumb components](#TODO).

## Hooks

- 💡: [General naming conventions](#content) apply.<br/>
- ✅: Do prefix all hooks with `use<HookName>`. Enforced by [ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks).

## Files

- ✅: Do use the name of the default exported component.<br/>
For files that don't export components 🤷.<br/>
Maybe just use a consistent format for all files regardless of content?<br/>
`kebab-case` seems to be fairly common for non-component files. It would form reasonably consistent import paths because NPM packages also [commonly use](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages) `kebab-case`<br/>
